# How to contribute

Contributions are always very much appreciated. However, to make sure the process of accepting patches goes smoothly for everyone (especially for the maintainer), you should try to follow these few simple guidelines when you contribute:

- Look first if you can find the [issues or feature request](https://github.com/anb0s/EasyShell/issues)
  - if you have found it then comment or add your additions there
  - if the issues is new then create one with good description (how to reproduce, versions of OS, eclipse, plugin etc.)
- if you want to provide fixes etc. look at [How-to-build](https://github.com/anb0s/EasyShell/wiki/How-to-build)
- create a pull request with your patch , good description and/or link to the issue
- help with testing the developer builds or reproduce issues
- help with needed patches and ideas :)
- Thanks!
