By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.

This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

(This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2, June 1991&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their&#xA;rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;&#xA;  Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed at all.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in&#xA;    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;    parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an&#xA;    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this&#xA;    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on&#xA;    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;&#xA;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;    received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;&#xA;  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;&#xA;       END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;&#xA;     How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;&#xA;  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&#xA;&#xA;  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify&#xA;    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#xA;    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or&#xA;    (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;    GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;&#xA;    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along&#xA;    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;    51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xA;&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;&#xA;    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;    Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w&apos;.&#xA;    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;    under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;&#xA;  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program&#xA;  `Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.&#xA;&#xA;  &lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;  Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into&#xA;proprietary programs.

To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.

This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.

Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.

If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.

This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.

You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.

If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.

Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7.

If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

(Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.

You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.

        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.

If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;Version 2, June 1991&#xA;Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA;of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;Preamble&#xA;The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General&#xA;Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change&#xA;free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.&#xA;This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors&#xA;commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered&#xA;by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply&#xA;it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom,&#xA;not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure&#xA;that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge&#xA;for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can&#xA;get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces&#xA;of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the&#xA;rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for&#xA;you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights&#xA;that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can&#xA;get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know&#xA;their&#xA;rights.&#xA;We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,&#xA;and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to&#xA;copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make&#xA;certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this&#xA;free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed&#xA;on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original,&#xA;so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the&#xA;original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of&#xA;a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making&#xA;the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear&#xA;that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed&#xA;at all.&#xA;The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;,&#xA;below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the&#xA;Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright&#xA;law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of&#xA;it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into&#xA;another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation&#xA;in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification&#xA;are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act&#xA;of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the&#xA;Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all&#xA;the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any&#xA;warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,&#xA;and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange&#xA;for a fee.&#xA;2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section&#xA;1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that&#xA;in&#xA;whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display&#xA;an&#xA;announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of&#xA;this&#xA;License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;does not normally print such an announcement, your work based&#xA;on&#xA;the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works&#xA;in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to&#xA;those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when&#xA;you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work&#xA;based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the&#xA;terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to&#xA;the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who&#xA;wrote it.&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or&#xA;contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent&#xA;is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative&#xA;or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the&#xA;Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume&#xA;of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work&#xA;under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on&#xA;it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the&#xA;terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange;&#xA;or,&#xA;b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xA;for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete&#xA;source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus&#xA;any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used&#xA;to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

However,&#xA;as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)&#xA;of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are&#xA;not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program&#xA;is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this&#xA;License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you&#xA;under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long&#xA;as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have&#xA;not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify&#xA;or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions&#xA;are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore,&#xA;by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do&#xA;so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based&#xA;on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from&#xA;the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject&#xA;to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted&#xA;herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties&#xA;to&#xA;this License.&#xA;7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of&#xA;patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement&#xA;or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they&#xA;do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under&#xA;this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence&#xA;you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program&#xA;by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,&#xA;then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would&#xA;be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable&#xA;under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended&#xA;to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe&#xA;any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity&#xA;of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting&#xA;the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of&#xA;that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is&#xA;willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee&#xA;cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed&#xA;to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted&#xA;in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,&#xA;the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or&#xA;among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new&#xA;versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions&#xA;will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in&#xA;detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xA;Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it&#xA;and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and&#xA;conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the&#xA;Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version&#xA;number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the&#xA;Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other&#xA;free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to&#xA;the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by&#xA;the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we&#xA;sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the&#xA;two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free&#xA;software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS&#xA;NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. &#xA;EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER&#xA;PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER&#xA;EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES&#xA;OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE&#xA;RISK AS&#xA;TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD&#xA;THE&#xA;PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY&#xA;SERVICING,&#xA;REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xA;12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO&#xA;IN WRITING&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY&#xA;AND/OR&#xA;REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU&#xA;FOR DAMAGES,&#xA;INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES&#xA;ARISING&#xA;OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT&#xA;NOT LIMITED&#xA;TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED&#xA;BY&#xA;YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH&#xA;ANY OTHER&#xA;PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED&#xA;OF THE&#xA;POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.&#xA;END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xA;How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xA;If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to&#xA;make it&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under&#xA;these terms.&#xA;To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is&#xA;safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at&#xA;least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is&#xA;found.&#xA;&lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what&#xA;it does.&gt;&#xA;Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or&#xA;modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published&#xA;by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License,&#xA;or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the&#xA;GNU General Public License for more details.&#xA;You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License&#xA;along&#xA;with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation,&#xA;Inc.,&#xA;51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA.&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and&#xA;paper mail.&#xA;If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice&#xA;like this&#xA;when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xA;Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author&#xA;Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type&#xA;`show w&apos;.&#xA;This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xA;under certain conditions; type `show c&apos; for details.&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w&apos; and `show c&apos; should show the&#xA;appropriate&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands&#xA;you use may&#xA;be called something other than `show w&apos; and `show c&apos;; they could&#xA;even be&#xA;mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.&#xA;You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer)&#xA;or your&#xA;school, if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program,&#xA;if&#xA;necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:&#xA;Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the&#xA;program&#xA;`Gnomovision&apos; (which makes passes at compilers) written by James&#xA;Hacker.&#xA;&lt;signature of Ty Coon&gt;, 1 April 1989&#xA;Ty Coon, President of Vice&#xA;This General Public License does not permit incorporating your&#xA;program into&#xA;proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library,&#xA;you may&#xA;consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications&#xA;with the&#xA;library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser&#xA;General&#xA;Public License instead of this License.

          GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;         Version 2, June 1991&#xA;&#xA; Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.,&#xA; 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA&#xA; Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies&#xA; of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.&#xA;&#xA;       Preamble&#xA;&#xA;  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your&#xA;freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public&#xA;License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free&#xA;software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This&#xA;General Public License applies to most of the Free Software&#xA;Foundation&apos;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to&#xA;using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by&#xA;the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to&#xA;your programs, too.&#xA;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xA;this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it&#xA;if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it&#xA;in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.&#xA;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid&#xA;anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.&#xA;These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you&#xA;distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.&#xA;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that&#xA;you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the&#xA;source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their&#xA;rights.&#xA;&#xA;  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and&#xA;(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,&#xA;distribute and/or modify the software.&#xA;&#xA;  Also, for each author&apos;s protection and ours, we want to make certain&#xA;that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free&#xA;software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we&#xA;want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so&#xA;that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original&#xA;authors&apos; reputations.&#xA;&#xA;  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software&#xA;patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free&#xA;program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the&#xA;program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any&#xA;patent must be licensed for everyone&apos;s free use or not licensed at all.&#xA;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xA;modification follow.&#xA;&#xA;      GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#xA;   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION&#xA;&#xA;  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains&#xA;a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed&#xA;under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,&#xA;refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;&#xA;means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:&#xA;that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,&#xA;either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another&#xA;language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in&#xA;the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.&#xA;&#xA;Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not&#xA;covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of&#xA;running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program&#xA;is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the&#xA;Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).&#xA;Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.&#xA;&#xA;  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&apos;s&#xA;source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you&#xA;conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate&#xA;copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the&#xA;notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;&#xA;and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License&#xA;along with the Program.&#xA;&#xA;You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and&#xA;you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.&#xA;&#xA;  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion&#xA;of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and&#xA;distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1&#xA;above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xA;&#xA;    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices&#xA;    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.&#xA;&#xA;    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in&#xA;    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any&#xA;    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third&#xA;    parties under the terms of this License.&#xA;&#xA;    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively&#xA;    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such&#xA;    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an&#xA;    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a&#xA;    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide&#xA;    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under&#xA;    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this&#xA;    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but&#xA;    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on&#xA;    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)&#xA;&#xA;These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If&#xA;identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,&#xA;and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in&#xA;themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those&#xA;sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you&#xA;distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based&#xA;on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of&#xA;this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the&#xA;entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.&#xA;&#xA;Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest&#xA;your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to&#xA;exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or&#xA;collective works based on the Program.&#xA;&#xA;In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program&#xA;with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of&#xA;a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under&#xA;the scope of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,&#xA;under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of&#xA;Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:&#xA;&#xA;    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable&#xA;    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections&#xA;    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;&#xA;    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three&#xA;    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your&#xA;    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete&#xA;    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be&#xA;    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange; or,&#xA;&#xA;    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer&#xA;    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is&#xA;    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you&#xA;    received the program in object code or executable form with such&#xA;    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)&#xA;&#xA;The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for&#xA;making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source&#xA;code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any&#xA;associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to&#xA;control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a&#xA;special exception, the source code distributed need not include&#xA;anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary&#xA;form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the&#xA;operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component&#xA;itself accompanies the executable.&#xA;&#xA;If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering&#xA;access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent&#xA;access to copy the source code from the same place counts as&#xA;distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not&#xA;compelled to copy the source along with the object code.&#xA;&#xA;  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program&#xA;except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt&#xA;otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is&#xA;void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.&#xA;However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under&#xA;this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such&#xA;parties remain in full compliance.&#xA;&#xA;  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not&#xA;signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or&#xA;distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are&#xA;prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by&#xA;modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and&#xA;all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying&#xA;the Program or works based on it.&#xA;&#xA;  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the&#xA;Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the&#xA;original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to&#xA;these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further&#xA;restrictions on the recipients&apos; exercise of the rights granted herein.&#xA;You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to&#xA;this License.&#xA;&#xA;  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent&#xA;infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),&#xA;conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot&#xA;distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you&#xA;may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent&#xA;license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by&#xA;all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then&#xA;the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to&#xA;refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.&#xA;&#xA;If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under&#xA;any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to&#xA;apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other&#xA;circumstances.&#xA;&#xA;It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any&#xA;patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any&#xA;such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the&#xA;integrity of the free software distribution system, which is&#xA;implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made&#xA;generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed&#xA;through that system in reliance on consistent application of that&#xA;system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing&#xA;to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot&#xA;impose that choice.&#xA;&#xA;This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to&#xA;be a consequence of the rest of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in&#xA;certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the&#xA;original copyright holder who places the Program under this License&#xA;may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding&#xA;those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among&#xA;countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates&#xA;the limitation as if written in the body of this License.&#xA;&#xA;  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions&#xA;of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xA;&#xA;Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program&#xA;specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any&#xA;later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions&#xA;either of that version or of any later version published by the Free&#xA;Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of&#xA;this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software&#xA;Foundation.&#xA;&#xA;  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free&#xA;programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author&#xA;to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free&#xA;Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes&#xA;make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals&#xA;of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and&#xA;of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.&#xA;&#xA;       NO WARRANTY&#xA;&#xA;  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY&#xA;FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN&#xA;OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES&#xA;PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED&#xA;OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It is safest&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xA;convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xA;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the program&apos;s name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xA;&#xA;    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify&#xA;    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#xA;    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or&#xA;    (at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
